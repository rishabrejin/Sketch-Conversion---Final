# Sketch-Conversion---Final
We aim to convert sketches of face images to their photo realistic versions

This project aims to construct a photo-realistic version of hand-drawn sketches of human faces using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. 

 Additionally, we also propose to use our trained network for the purpose of colorization of grey-scale images and videos.
 
 The sample images are provided in this repository.
 
 To predict a model run python model_predict.py <image_name>
